# Score Matching Riemannian Diffusion Means
This repository contains the code for the paper, "Score Matching Riemannian Difffusion Means". The code is based on jaxgeometry.

## Reproducing Tables
The tables in the paper can be reproduced running "score_tables.ipynb.". For each manifold the dimension can be changed by the argument $N$ at the top of the subsection of the manifold.

## Reproducing Figures
All figures can be reproduced by running "score_plots.ipynb", where all parameters have been fixed in the code.

## Data
Data can be generated by running "generate_data.ipynb". All synthetic data have been saved in the folder, "Data", for reproducability.

## Learned Scores
The scores are learned by running the script "train_score.py" and passing suitable arguments. All learned scores, their network and parameters, have been saved in the folder "scores" under the appropiate manifold.
